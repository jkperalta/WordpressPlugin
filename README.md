# Wordpress Plugin (Assessment)

This custom plugin provides users with a unique way insert multiple HTML code sets within a post. These code sets can be inserted as forms, iframes, ads, etc. The plugin implementation also enables admin users to modify the feature to determine the content of the code sets, where they get placed, and when they should be used. The plugin is compatible with the default 2022 WordPress theme.


(Updated on 8/4/2022)
Here is a summary of what I was able to get done:
- Set up and used localhost to work on WordPress site locally
- Verified that plugin is compatible with 2022 WordPress theme
- Implemented functions to insert code sets at different points in post, according to user-specified inputs
- Implemented feature that restricts modifying code to admin users
- Enabled admin users create/update entries, disable/delete entries, modify insert conditions, set paragraph limit
- Tested plugin on WordPress site and verified that features worked correctly

Here is what I plan on doing to further improve the code:
- Implement code in the insertion functions to output various forms of media (Ex. forms, ads, iframes, images, audio, etc.)
- Implement includes/excludes feature to enable insertion based on matching data in the post
